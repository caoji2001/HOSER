### Framework Overview

![Framework](./assets/framework.png)

HOSER predicts the next spatio-temporal point based on the current state and generates the trajectory between the given OD pair through a search-based method. As illustrated above, HOSER first employs a Road Network Encoder to model the road network at different levels. Based on the road network representation, a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder is proposed to extract the semantic information from the current partial trajectory. To better incorporate prior knowledge of human mobility, a Destination-Oriented Navigator is used to seamlessly integrate the current partial trajectory semantics with the destination guidance.

### Requirements

The required packages with Python environment is:
```
torch
torch_geometric
tqdm
PyYAML
numpy
pandas
sklearn
shapely
tensorboard
haversine
loguru
```

### Running

* Data Preprocessing
  
  First, download the required dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/caoji2001/HOSER-dataset/tree/main) and place it in the data folder.

  Next, We use [KaHIP](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP), a graph partitioning framework, to partition the road network. First, we need to install KaHIP by executing the following commands in the terminal:

  ```console
  git clone --branch v3.17 https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP.git
  cd KaHIP
  mkdir build
  cd build 
  cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release     
  make
  cd ../..
  ```

  Finally, run our script to preprocess the data:

  ```console
  cd data/preprocess
  python partition_road_network.py
  python get_zone_trans_mat.py
  cd ../..
  ```

* Model Training

  `python train.py`
  * `--dataset` specifies the dataset, such as `Beijing`, `Porto`, or `San Francisco`
  * `--seed` specifies the random seed
  * `--cuda` specifies the GPU device number

* Trajectory Generation

  `python gene.py`
  * `--dataset` specifies the dataset, such as `Beijing`, `Porto`, or `San Francisco`
  * `--seed` specifies the random seed
  * `--cuda` specifies the GPU device number
  * `--num_gene` specifies the number of trajectories to generate
  * `--processes` specifies the number of processes to use when generating trajectories in parallel
